# infected-cell-dash-template
Dash app template

## Dependencies:
* Make sure to install conda
* The Visual Studio Code Python extension installed

## To run this project:
1. `cd infected-cell-dash_template`
2. `conda env create --file environment.yml` to create a conda environment with the required dependencies. *If you already have the environment installed you can skip this step.*
3. Open Visual Studio Code in the current directory with `code .`
4. To point VSCode to the right conda environment, select the `src/app.py` file.
5. Wait a few seconds for VSCode's Python extension to get started up.
6. In the bottom right corner, there should be a button that says "Select Python Interpreter". Click it and it should bring up a menu in the top middle. Select the environment that says `Python 3.XX.X ('dash-ds-infected-cell')`.
7. You're ready!

Visual Studio Code will remember all these settings, so there is no need to open the terminal and repeating these steps. Just open the folder in VSCode next time you need to open this project.
