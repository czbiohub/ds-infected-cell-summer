# infected-cell

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Node v10.16.0 or later is required.

### Scripts

- For development, use `npm start` to start a development server. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
- To build the app for production, use `npm run build`. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the Create React App documentation for more information.

### Developing

- `.scss` files used for React components will need to have the extension `.module.scss` now.
- Images go to the `public/images` folder.
