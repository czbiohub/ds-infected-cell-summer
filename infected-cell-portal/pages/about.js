            The Infected Cell Project presents a unique oppotunity to understand
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>viruses as a threat:</b> defining essential host pathways for
                infection and building assays for anti-viral screening
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>viruses as a tool:</b> following viruses to illuminate human
                cell biology
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>viruses as a forcing function:</b> to integrate Biohubâ€™s
                multi-disciplinary expertise
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge we aim to solve is how can we build approaches that
            can address both the diversity of viral families and the diversity
            of cellular responses that they generate.
          </p>
          <p>
            This current version of the Infected Cell Project utilizes CRISPR
            screen data from 10+ families of viruses in order to explore
            host-factor interactions. This enhances our understanding of the
            mechanisms of viral infection and helps to develop new technologies
            that will lead to actionable diagnostics and effective therapies.
