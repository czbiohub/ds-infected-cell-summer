              The Infected Cell Project presents a unique oppotunity to understand
              <li> <b>viruses as a threat:</b> defining essential host pathways for infection 
              and building assays for anti-viral screening</li>
              <li> <b>viruses as a tool:</b> following viruses to illuminate human cell biology </li>
              <li> <b>viruses as a forcing function:</b> to integrate Biohubâ€™s multi-disciplinary expertise</li>
              
              <p />
              The challenge we aim to solve is how can we build approaches that can address both the diversity 
              of viral families and the diversity of cellular responses that they generate. 
              
              <p />
              This current version of the Infected Cell Project utilizes CRISPR screen data from 10+ families 
              of viruses in order to explore host-factor interactions. This enhances our understanding 
              of the mechanisms of viral infection and helps to develop new technologies that 
              will lead to actionable diagnostics and effective therapies.
